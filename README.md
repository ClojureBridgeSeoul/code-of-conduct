== Bridge Foundry Code of Conduct ==

Bridge Foundry seeks to create a community of software developers that are reflective of the diversity in the general population. To that end, we are dedicated to creating welcoming and friendly learning environments.  All participants agree to the following:
* Everyone has something to contribute. Everyone deserves access to materials and community that will help them learn. As long as an individual can be respectful and not disruptive to other participants, they deserve to participate.
* If there is limited space and resources, anyone is welcome to replicate an event, such that more opportunities may be available. All RailsBridge curricula and organizing materials are open source and free. Provided that the organizer and event conform to RailsBridge guidelines, we will help.
* A harassment-free experience for everyone is essential. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at: [insert URL here]

Furthermore, workshops and associated "after party" must be safe environments focused on learning, which means:
* Use your words. If you feel like it would help to work directly on someone's keyboard, ask first. 
* Refer participants to open and free material for follow-up learning.  Feel free to provide your contact information or that of your company, but it is not appropriate to ask a student for their email address or phone number.
* If you are not sure if something is appropriate behavior, it probably isn't.
* Do not ask anyone out on a date.
